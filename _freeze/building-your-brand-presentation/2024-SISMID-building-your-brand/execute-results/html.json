How up-to-date is your profile?** \n:::\n::::\n\n\n## Employer listings\n* Depending on the employer, you might have a company entry.\n* Usually not directly controlled by you, not very flexible.\n* Use it as needed, but if possible, link to your own main web presence.\n* Examples:\n  - [Andreas Handel](https://publichealth.uga.edu/faculty-member/andreas-handel/)\n  - [Jim Rogers](https://www.metrumrg.com/team_member/james-rogers-ph-d/)\n\n\n\n## Social Media\n\n**Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, etc.**\n\n* Widely used.\n* Main use is **social**, not professional.\n* Potentially good way to stay connected with others.\n* Hard to keep professional and personal lives separated (unless you create 2 accounts).\n* Some people use those sites for professional purposes.

Or regularly consuming scientific/professional YouTube content?** \n:::\n::::\n\n\n## Podcasts\n* Very popular these days.\n* Seem like a lot of work (though maybe less than Youtube).\n* Be clear about goals and commitment (e.g. format/posting frequency) before you start.\n* Examples:\n  - [Not so Standard Deviations](https://nssdeviations.com/)\n  - [Casual Inference](https://casualinfer.libsyn.com/)\n\n::::{ .fragment}\n:::{ .discuss}\n**Anyone making/consuming scientific/professional podcasts?** \n:::\n::::\n\n\n\n# Academia/Science specific sites\n\n## Academia/Science specific sites\n* Google Scholar\n* ORCID\n* ResearchGate\n* Academia.edu\n* Mendeley\n* ImpactStory\n* Publons\n* ...\n\n## Google Scholar \n* Only for publications (broadly speaking).\n* Gives citation metrics.\n* Is fairly automated, you have to do very little.\n* Great way to keep track of your papers.\n* Examples:\n  - [Natalie Dean](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=H7nim_oAAAAJ&inst=15365353816232672843)\n  - [Catherine Beauchemin](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=DaDJG8kAAAAJ&hl=en&inst=15365353816232672843)\n\n__If I want to get a quick idea what research someone does in academia, I check their Google Scholar page. If they don't have one, I'm annoyed.__\n\n## ORCID\n* Gives you a unique ID to track your research productivity.\n* Used by a lot of journals.\n* Very useful if you have a (slightly) common name (but even if not).\n* Free and not-for-profit.\n* __If you plan on staying in academia/research, you should set up ORCID.__\n* Examples:\n  - [Stephanie Eick](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6695-3291)\n  - [Andrew Heiss](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3948-3914)\n\n\n\n## ResearchGate/Academia/Mendeley/etc.\n* Types of academic social network sites.\n* All are commercial (as far as I know).\n* You have various levels of control of how your profile looks like.\n* Examples:\n  - [Stephanie Eick](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stephanie_Eick)\n\n\n::::{ .fragment}\n:::{ .discuss}\n**Anyone using any of those sites, if yes how?** \n:::\n::::\n\n\n<!-- _Personally, I haven't found those sites useful. I deleted my accounts on those sites since I want to control my web presence and don't want to keep too many sites up-to-date._ -->\n\n\n\n## ImpactStory/Kudos/Publons/etc. \n* Sites that try to measure your 'impact'.\n* Maybe fun, but I haven't found them too useful (yet).\n* As metrics beyond grants/papers become more important, sites like these might become more useful.\n\n* Examples:\n  - [Alison Hill](https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0002-8082-1890)\n  - [Andreas Handel](https://profiles.impactstory.org/u/0000-0002-4622-1146)\n\n\n# Your own site\n\n\n## Own website\n* You have complete control.\n* You have to build and maintain it yourself.\n* Lot's of ways to do that. Many are free.\n\n::::{ .fragment}\n:::{ .discuss}\n**Who has their own website? How did you make it, how do you use/maintain it?** \n:::\n::::\n\n\n\n## Website builders\n* Google Sites, Wordpress, Wix,...\n* Some free, some paid, some ads\n* Limited flexibility for free versions\n* Usually easy to use\n* Examples:\n  - [Katia Koelle (Wordpress)](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/koellelab/)\n  - [Micaela Martinez (Wordpress)](https://memartinez.org/)\n  - [Emily Ricotta (Wix)](https://www.emilyricotta.com/)\n\n## Build your own\n* Using some software stack to make your own website\n* More flexibility\n* Usually a bit more technically challenging\n* Fairly easy these days using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/)\n* Examples:\n  - [Zane Billings](https://wzbillings.com/)\n  - [Jadey Ryan](https://jadeyryan.com/)\n* Resources:\n\t- [Nice tutorial](https://jadeyryan.com/blog/2024-02-19_beginner-quarto-netlify/) and [a short summary](https://wzbillings.com/posts/2024-07-13-quarto-website-checklist/)\n\n# General thoughts and suggestions\n\n## Have a plan\n* Decide what you want to be known for, create and curate content accordingly. \n* Start with an overall goal/idea for your site(s) before you create them.\n\t- Why are you doing this?\n  - What do you (not) want to put out there?\n  - What do you (not) want to be known for?\n  - Who is (not) your audience?\n  - What is (not) the purpose of your online presence?\n\n## Be picky\n* Give some thought to the platforms you want to (not) use.\n* Better have fewer online outlets that you keep up-to-date with good quantity/quality content than being on too many platforms.\n* You don't need to duplicate, e.g. you can/should link sites (e.g. link to your Google Scholar publications from LinkedIn).\n* Adopt the platforms that work for you (e.g. LinkedIn vs. Youtube vs. Blog vs. TikTok vs...)\n\n\n## Be consistent\n* In general, stick to \"your\" topics. If you are known for topics X and Y, the decision to talk about Z should be planned/deliberate.\n* Start simple/easy/slow, then ramp up. Better an update a month than a month long 'binge' followed by a year of no updates. \n* Be consistent. One blog post/video/piece of content a week for a year is better than 52 in a single week and nothing else after that.\n\n**Occasional changes in overall content/structure/frequency are ok, but try to be deliberate.**\n\n## Content is king\n* You can spend/waste a lot of time fiddling with the layout and styling (trust me, I've done that).\n* In the end, good content is what matters most.\n* Examples:\n  - [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/)\n  - [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/)\n\n\n## If in doubt, make it public\n* Anything that might be useful to others (or your future self) is worth putting out there.\n* Things don't always need to be polished, but you should have some minimum standard of quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./media/normal-work.png){fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![[Andrew Heiss](https://talks.andrewheiss.com/2020-10-23_utah-web-presence/). Origin (?): [Start a blog](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/)](./media/public-work.png){fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Some advertising is needed\n* If people don't find you, your impact is low.\n* Cross-link to your various online locations.\n* Use platforms to promote your content (e.g. LinkedIn).\n* Don't worry too much about search engine optimization (SEO). If you create good and persistent content, you should soon show up on top.\n\n## Keep track (a little bit)\n* Set Google alerts for your name (or other keywords).\n* Consider measuring your impact (e.g. Site visits, Software downloads, Twitter followers, GitHub stars).\n* Those metrics can be useful for career advancement, but don't get too hung up about them.\n* Examples:\n  - [DSAIDE R package](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIDE/)\n  \n\n## Warnings\n* Anything you put online is there \"forever\", even if you delete it later.\n* Be professional, even if you decide to post content that's not directly career related.\n* Online can be a HUGE time and attention suck!\n\n**Always be mindful of the ultimate reason for having an online presence/brand. Let that guide the quality and quantity of your online activities.**\n\n\n## Summary\n\n**You need an online presence that you control.**\n\n* Minimum: Decent LinkedIn site, maybe augmented with Google Scholar or similar. \n* Better:  Also own website with links to your other online outlets.\n* Advanced: Also become active on certain platforms (regular blogs/videos/podcasts/tweets, etc.).\n\n",
