## DSAIRM R package

* R package to learn/explore mechanistic simulation models: https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIRM/
* Modular design, starts with no-code approach, allows advancement to coding.
* Each simulation app comes with model description and a set of suggested tasks that teach a specific modeling concept.
* Full solutions to all tasks are available (on request).


## Learning DSAIRM

* The goal is to have a very low barrier to use. If you can use Excel/Prism, you can use this üòÅ.
* Main resource is package website: [https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIRM/](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIRM/)
* See some materials on the [SMI site.](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse/)
* Also [this paper in BMC Immunology](https://bmcimmunol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12865-019-0321-0).


## DSAIRM Strengths/Weaknesses {.smaller}

* The good
  * Starts out completely code-free.
  * Good number of within-host modeling topics are covered.
  * Set of guided exercises/tasks to help learn the material.
  * Full access to underlying model code.
* The bad
  * Only the models I wrote are available.
  * Custom models (e.g., for research) will require adapting one of the existing models, which means having to write code.
  * Package name is maybe awkward (taking suggestions for better naming).
